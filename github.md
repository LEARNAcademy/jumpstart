TO DO (github):
Set html file to index.html
Create a github account (it’s free) at www.github.com. You will need to remember your github handle (username) and your password to deploy your application. 
Together we will create a repository and use GitHub
Pages
(https://pages.github.com/) to deploy our project

Steps to Deploy:
1.Create a repository using this specific naming convention`
for the repository name: {your username}.github.io
2.Public repository option is selected by default. You’ll want to keep the
repository public otherwise you won’t be able to see your Treasure Hunt Game when you visit the url
3. Ignore all other options and click the “Create repository” button
4. Ensure that your html document for your Treasure Hunt Game is named exactly as index.html
5. Click the “upload an existing file” link.
6. Upload all your files. Order of upload does not matter. You should be able to see the name of your files appear when the upload is complete.
7. Add a commit message. A “commit” is like a snapshot of your changes. A commit message is used to communicate information about your changes. There’s not much to say at the moment so we’ll just say that this is our “Initial commit”. Click the “Commit changes” button.
8. Visit your GitHub Page URL: https://{your username}.github.io
9. Enjoy and share the URL with friends and family
