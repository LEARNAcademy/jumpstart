# Deployment

Deployment is the process of making your project accessible to others on the Internet. We'll be using GitHub to host your website.

### What is GitHub? 
It’s a web app that most importantly allows users to share code. It uses Git which is a version control tool (something that allows you to track the history of changes made to your code). GitHub Pages is a feature on GitHub that allows you to make your website available to the Internet. Also know that you can only host one website per user account. 

For more information: https://pages.github.com/

## Step 1: GitHub Desktop Setup
[Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

This is a tool that will allow you to see changes made to your projects.

[Install GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)

[Log in using your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github)


## Step 2: Create a repository. 
A repository is a specific location where you can store your project. Think of it as a folder or directory. In the version control context, this directory and changes to any files in it are being tracked.

The repository name for a GitHub Page is very specific. When text has a specific style/format that it must follow, it is called “naming convention”. The naming convention for a GitHub Page repository is username.github.io. You’ll be able to use this repository name as a url to visit your page once your project is hosted.

Make sure that the Public option is selected. 
Checking Private will not allow others to view your page.

Skip creating the README for now. 
Also skip other options.

Click “Create repository”.


## Step 3: Committing & Publishing
“Committing" your changes is saving your changes. “Pushing" is uploading your changed files. 

Check your History tab to see the last commit is present.

Current Branch: master (this is like the master copy)

Repo on GitHub should still display “Quick setup” content

Click "Publish branch”. This uploads your changes to GitHub.

Refresh your repo on github.com and you should see the files.

Visit username.github.io through your browser to see the hosted page!


## Step 4: Making updates
Make changes to your files.

When you’re ready to commit, go to GitHub Desktop.

Commit changes to master.

Publish branch to GitHub.

Refresh username.github.io to see changes reflected.
