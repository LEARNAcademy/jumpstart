The Jumpstart Volunteer pipeline curriculum is designed to bring volunteers up to speed performing the role of teaching assistants. When they show promise of being reliable as teaching assistants, then scouting them as potential instructors. Equipping the individuals with the ability to teach Jumpstart and utilize their skill as part of the teaching environment at LEARN. 

This curriculum is broken into 3 sections:
First time volunteers
Teaching assistant: Assigning responsibilities to consistent volunteers
Selecting and onboarding new instructors for Jumpstart

First time volunteers
Each student at LEARN academy is offered multiple opportunities to volunteer with extra-curricular activities in the LEARN ecosystem. It is a best practice to get as many of the current students to volunteer for Jumpstart, BYFW, and Mini-jumpstart as possible. These exp provide  invaluable skill and opportunity including connecting to the wider LEARN community. 

All First time volunteers will need to attend a briefing that is held during lunch hours either Thursday or Friday before jumpstart. 


The meeting should cover
What the role of the volunteers is
Getting caught up with the TA handbook
Looking over the TA github
https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/JumpStart-TA
Not using the build out example as answers to students
What to expect when the breakout rooms open 
What to do when jumping into the rooms
Introduce yourselves
Ask if they need help
If not leave
If so help think through the problem
Look at notes
How to best help students
Revisit planning
How to give feedback to the instructors for the students
Keep record in the volunteers channel
Time frames 
And other expectations

Generally each Jumpstart will have one or two volunteers who stand out: either by showing up for more than their “shift”; connecting with students in a particularly effective way; Showcasing LEARN’s Brave Space ideals; etc…

These volunteers should be taken note of and encouraged to attend more jumpstart events that we hold. 
Assigning responsibilities to consistent teaching assistant
Empowering Returning TA’s is a goal of the LEARN instruction team. TA’s who are on their third or fourth Jumpstart should be empowered with one or more of the following responsibilities:
Taking attendance and sharing it in the #Jumpstart-Volunteers channel
Running the Volunteer Onboarding meeting
Letting new volunteers shadow them in breakout rooms
Participating in Pair Programming demonstration with the Instructor
Providing the instructor feedback for how students are responding to the lecture
What worked and what didn’t
Selecting and onboarding new instructors for Jumpstart

The goal of this curriculum is to have TA’s join the instruction team and teach Jumpstart. Jumpstart sections are broken into 6 lessons:
HTML
Javascript part 1
Javascript part 2
CSS Part 1
CSS part 2
GitHub

HTML, and CSS part 1 are great lessons to be taught by someone who is new to instruction. 
Css Part 2 and Github are good recommendations for people who want to expand their instruction skills. 
Javascript 1 & 2 should be reserved for experienced instructors as it poses a lot of student questions but would be a perfect fit for someone teaching for the third time. 

TA’s who have attended ______ number of jumpstarts while consistently being assigned responsibilities and fulfilling their role should be considered for this position. The TA will need to be reached out to with the permission of the DOAX and CEO of LEARN. The CEO and DOAX of LEARN will settle on a compensation package with the prospective Instructor in question. The new instructor should familiarize themselves with the current state of the Jumpstart Instructor notes for their responsible presentations.
